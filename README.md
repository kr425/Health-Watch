# Health-Watch
Development of a Health Watch for Daily Monitoring of Stress and Disease. This work was the software portion of a thesis that was completed for an MSEE. 
The modules within this repository extract the PPG signal from the device, calcuate the HR, HRV and RR.
Each module is written in C using the TM4C123GH6PM MCU and the Tivaware libraries.
The analog front end for the HR is the AFE4404. Main and much of the key modules are left out of the repository.
